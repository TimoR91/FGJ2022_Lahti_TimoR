The focus of this game development was about implementing Unreal Engine's Metahuman and LiveLink to game. Metahuman provides realistic human characters. LiveLink is used to make facial animations to characters via mobile phone camera. LiveLink phone app is only on iOS unfortunately. I have android phone so i had to find some plugins to get motion cap working. It's not perfect quality on android compared to iOS-version but it provided decent quality for testing. Game takes heavy inspiration of finnish classic "Sakarin villapaitapeli".
